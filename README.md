# Clinton-vs-Unemployment
2016 Democratic vote vs Unemployment 2019. 

I am looking to compare the how likely a county was to vote democratic or republican vs the unemployment rate. 
My thought is that the more likely a county voted democratic in 2016 the higher the unemployment rate is. 

I am using r in the analysis. The vote data comes from Deleetdk on github at: "https://github.com/Deleetdk/USA.county.data/blob/master/data/USA_county_data.RData"
I pulled the unemployment data from: "https://www.bls.gov/web/metro/laucntycur14.txt"

You can see the code, but I was only able to get 2019 data, so it just shows a more average time period. Still a positive correlation between percent democratic vote and unemployment.
That means that the higher the unemployment the more likely your county is to have voted democratic in 2016. Not to supprising considering that democrates are a bigger fan of 
spending money on people who are unemployed and earn below average amounts of money.
